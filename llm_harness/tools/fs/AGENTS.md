# Codemap: `llm_harness/tools/fs`

## Scope

- Filesystem and transcript-line manipulation helpers designed for tool-calling workflows.

## High-signal locations

- `llm_harness/tools/fs/fs_tools.py -> SandboxFS/make_fs_tools`
- `llm_harness/tools/fs/fast_copy.py -> TagRange/tag_content/filter_content/untag_content`

## Key takeaways per location

- `SandboxFS.resolve` is the trust boundary: strips/normalizes user paths, rejects traversal, and enforces root containment.
- `make_fs_tools` creates LangChain tools for read/write/edit operations inside the sandbox.
- `fast_copy.py` provides deterministic line-tag transforms used to remove identified garbage transcript ranges.

## Project-specific conventions and rationale

- Keep sandbox path checks strict and centralized in `SandboxFS`.
- Preserve UTF-8 text semantics for read/write helpers.
- `ed`-based editing exists for LLM-friendly line patching; non-zero `ed` exit codes must surface as runtime errors.
- Tag filtering operates on inclusive ranges and keeps untouched order stable.

## Syntax relationship highlights (ast-grep-first)

- `fs_tools.py -> make_fs_tools -> fs_read_text/fs_write_text/fs_edit_with_ed`
- `fs_tools.py -> fs_edit_with_ed -> subprocess.run([ed, ...])`
- `fast_copy.py -> filter_content -> TagRange(start_tag/end_tag)`
- `agents/youtube/summarizer.py -> tag_content/filter_content/untag_content`

## General approach (not rigid checklist)

- Modify path behavior only through `SandboxFS.resolve` to avoid split-brain security rules.
- Keep `fast_copy` transforms pure and side-effect free.
- Treat these functions as low-level primitives reused by higher-level agents.
